# Ruby on Rails (MVC Framework)

what our MVC acronym refers to is the way we direct traffic (with a controller) as it comes in from an external source, looks for data (monitored by the model), and is displayed for the user (through the view).

```
If you don't need a version manager, install Ruby using the Homebrew package manager. 
Use this approach if you are only building a casual project that you will not maintain, 
or if you are just trying out Ruby to learn the language. 
You can easily remove Ruby after installing with Homebrew (and re-install a newer version when you need it). 
Don't install Ruby with Homebrew if you need to switch among Ruby versions (use asdf or frum in this case).
